# Cloud Computing Final Project 

Cloud Computing is a service provided over the internet, usually these services spand from domain registering, website hosting and online forms of storage like DropBox and Google Drive. AWS provides all of these cloud services and more. In this report we will go over all the many uses of AWS and how it can benefit your business.

Here are the main sections of this report:

## Cloud Concepts 
The Amazon Cloud platform provides users with cloud-based products and services that are designed to work together. There are many different catogories of sercives, each with their own unique tools and softwares for developmemt in the cloud, many of these services provide specific uses for an organizations goals. Shifting to a Cloud services can be tricky for businesses because most companies rely on technology for technical infatrtructure and record keeping. Luckily AWS Cloud Adoption Framework can support businesses while they make their shift over the AWS, so, how does AWS help business make this leap to a whole new system? AWS CAF provides guidance when it comes to making the big switch to a new platform, IT professional at AWS aim to help the adoption of businesses by breaking down the process into managable steps. So what are the advantages of using Amazon Cloud Services vs the traditional IT structure. 

1. Trade Capital expense for variable expense: Managing something yourself, let's say a database. When creating a large scale database it requires physical space, power, cooling, maintenance and upkeep costs. Managing all of these expenses can be time consuming for a business and some of those databases may never be used, or on the other hand, a business may have underestimated it's work load and need to buy more equipment. With Cloud services you do not need to manage anything on the hardware, and you need only to pay for what you use. A system like this allows businesses to easily set a budget on the resources used and manage those resources affectively.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale: By using cloud computing you can achiece lower cost of services than you would on your own. AWS is built for scale so huge amounts of computational power can be easily managed by the AWS platform, giving the user a better service while keeping the cost low.

3. Stop guessing capacity: As stated before the cost of setting a IT system up can be a rigorious task, a business needs an accurate idea of the technical capacity.  Guessing too high can cause a business to invest for money and time than need. Guessing too low can cause a business to run into problems with load management later down the line. Using AWS helps to remove that problem by allowing the user to manage the amount of capacity need and maxamize cost effectiveness.

4. Increase speed and agility: In AWS, services are just a click away most of the time. Allowing users to create new resources and remove ones that are no longer in us or needed. This kind of flexability allows users to easily experiement with new IT structures while not having to commit to one way of achieving a desired outcome. 

5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers: This is a simple idea, the less time you spend on maintaining what you have, the more time you can spend improving it. Having AWS professionals managae the upkeep tasks allows business to focus on moving foreword and improving other aspects of the business.

6. Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your application to multiple regions around the world fast any easy with AWS. Using AWS for this reasons can improve lower latency and provide a better user experience.

## Cloud Economics & Billing
Unlike many cloud service providers, AWS is a pay as you go system. Which mean that unlike many online services it does not generally ask for a static payment like many service providers. That is because AWS's pay as you go system only charges you for resources you use, meaning that you pay for what you use rather the pay for what you get system that many providers use. 

Main financial benefits of using AWS: 

1. You only have to pay for the resources, processing power and data transmission that is needed.

2. Paying a larger up front amount on services can save you up to 75 percent over the equivalent on-demand capacity.

3. Pay less for using more, pay for more storage and procession power can actually decrease the cost of those resources over all.

4. Pay less as AWS becomes larger, since 2006 AWS has lowered pricing 75 times.

## Global Infrastructure
AWS Global Infastructure is designed and built to deliver flexible, reliabel, fast, scalable and secure cloud computing enviroment to many regions around the world. This allows you to develop and deploy applications across many regions based on variables like data governance, proximity to customers, service availability and cost. Availability zones are made for these exact reasons, they are comprised of a data center that holds information in that region. 

What are the benefits of setting up availablility zones: 

1. They are designed for fault isolation

2. They are interconnected with other availability zones by using high-speed private networking.

3. You choose the availability zone

4. Multiple availability zones allows faster latency speeds for users.
